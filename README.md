👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Tomi! 🚀
I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a deep love for TypeScript, Node.js, and React. Recently, I've been diving into the world of React Native, building mobile apps and pushing the limits of what's possible on mobile platforms.

When I'm not writing code, you’ll probably find me working on APIs, exploring new technologies, or fine-tuning my latest project. My goal is always to build clean, scalable, and efficient applications that push the boundaries of modern web and mobile development.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React, React Native, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express
Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
Tools & Libraries: tRPC, AWS, Git, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jest, Vitest
Others: REST APIs, GraphQL
🚗 In My Free Time
I'm a car enthusiast with a particular love for sportscars and cabriolets. Catch me in the garage or at a local track!
When I'm not driving, you’ll find me at the gym almost every day — staying fit keeps me sharp and focused.
And of course, I love to code and explore new challenges, especially when they involve tackling complex systems or learning new frameworks.
