# 👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Tomi! 🚀

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a deep love for TypeScript, Node.js, and React. Recently, I've been diving into the world of React Native, building mobile apps and pushing the limits of what's possible on mobile platforms.<br/>
When I'm not writing code, you’ll probably find me working on APIs, exploring new technologies, or fine-tuning my latest project. My goal is always to build clean, scalable, and efficient applications that push the boundaries of modern web and mobile development.<br/>


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, React Native<br/>
Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express<br/>
Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL<br/>
Tools & Libraries: tRPC, AWS, Git, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jest, Vitest<br/>
Others: REST APIs, GraphQL<br/>

## 🚗 In My Free Time

I'm a car enthusiast with a particular love for sportscars and cabriolets. Catch me in the garage or at a local track!<br/>
When I'm not driving, you’ll find me at the gym almost every day — staying fit keeps me sharp and focused.<br/>
And of course, I love to code and explore new challenges, especially when they involve tackling complex systems or learning new frameworks.<br/>
